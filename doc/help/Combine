combine -- combine files together (EXTERNAL) [v1.0]
           Written by Jeff Ding

syntax:  combine <input pathname1> [<input pathname2..5>]
                 [-o<output pathname>] [-w<margin>]

ex:      combine text -m60
         combine game.part1 game.part2 game.3 -o game
         combine =.header =.doc -o documents

'Combine' combines files together.  The input file is always appended to
the output file.  A total of 5 input files on the same command line is
supported.  Wildcards are supported in the first two input files only.
When using an output pathname, it is sometimes useful to use a wildcard in
the input pathname.  This allows you to append several files onto one
output pathname.

A special case happens when using two wildcards in the input files.  The
text matching the first wildcard is substituted into the second wildcard.
This makes it possible to include a special header or footer file for each
actual input file.  The third example above demonstrates the use of a
header file.

Combine will work with any file type, but the files are treated only
as raw collections of bytes.  This means, for example, that if you
combine two complete AWP files you will get a big mess.  However,
you can always use 'combine' to reconstruct files that have been
split up using 'split'.

Options are as follows:

    -o <pathname>: Copy of input file gets saved to this file.  If
                   not specified, output goes to the screen.  If the
                   file exists, the data will be appended and the type
                   not modified.  If the output file does not exist,
                   it will be created with the same type as the original
                   file.

    -w <margin>: wrap margin.  Affects output to the screen only.  This
                 forces a carriage return when either the margin or
                 a space within 9 characters of the margin is reached.
                 Allowed values are 0 through 255.  A 0 value has the
                 same effect as not using the option.
