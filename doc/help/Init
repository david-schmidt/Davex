init -- initialize a ProDOS disk (EXTERNAL) [v1.2]

syntax:  init device-number [volume-name] [-p] [-b] [-1] [-w]

ex:      init .52 /mydisk
         init .61 -b
         init .61 -p
         init .51 -1 -b
         init .71 -w

Initializes a ProDOS volume.  If the volume in the specified device
has already been initialized, init warns you that the existing volume
will be destroyed.

If no volume name is specified, the new volume is named "/blank".

If -p is given, init prompts you to insert the disk to be formatted.
If -b ("batch") is given, 'init' prompts you to insert another disk
after each successful format.

If -1 is given and a disk in an Apple 3.5 or Unidisk 3.5 drive is
being formatted, the disk will be formatted SINGLE SIDED and will
have a capacity of 400K (800 blocks).

If -w is given, no formatting is done--instead, just the "boot
blocks" (blocks 0 and 1) are written to the disk.  This is
necessary, for example, to make a RAM disk (or a disk formatted
in AppleWorks) bootable.  (The program contained in blocks 0 and
1 finds and loads a file called PRODOS in the main directory of
the disk.)
