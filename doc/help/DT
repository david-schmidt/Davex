dt -- print date and time (if available)

syntax:  dt

ex:      dt
         como %log;dt

Prints date and time.  This is fairly useless used alone,
since you can get the same information by just hitting
RETURN.  But it may be handy if output is redirected.  The
second example above, if placed in %AUTOEXEC, will keep a
log of all times Davex was entered.
