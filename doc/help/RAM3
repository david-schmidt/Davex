ram3 -- disable/enable ram drive (EXTERNAL) [v1.1]  Written by Jeff Ding

syntax:  ram3 {[-r] [-f]} {[-a] [-vxxxxx] [-ixx]}

ex:      ram3
         ram3 -r -f
         ram3 -a
         ram3 -a -v65280 -i15

'ram3' is used to disable the ram driver in slot 3 drive 2.  Once
disabled, you can then use the auxiliary memory in your computer
for programs or for double hi-res.

'ram3' with no options will tell you if it is installed or not.
Other options are as follows:

    -r: remove -- This option will remove the driver in slot 3 drive
        2.  You will be notified and asked to remove the volume if it
        is not empty.  If the vector or the identification of
        the ram driver is different from the standard, it will be
        printed along with a message stating the driver has been
        removed.  See -v and -i for the description of the vector
        and identification.  Be sure to keep track of these values
        so that when you want to re-install the driver you can use
        the original values.

        -f: force removal -- This option used in connection with the
            -r option will remove the driver even if the volume is
            not empty.  Use this option with caution!
 
    -a: add -- This option alone will re-install the standard ProDOS
        64k /ram driver.  This option alone will not work on a II+ because
        it does not have the necessary auxiliary memory and driver.  If you
        want to install a driver for a third party ram card on a II+, you
        must use the -a option in conjunction with the -v option. 
       
        -v: vector -- This option used in connection with the -a option
            will allow you to install a driver at a specific location
            xxxxx.  This vector points to the entry point of the driver
            routine.  The location for the standard /ram driver is 65280.

        -i: identification -- This option used in connection with the -a
            option will allow you to set the identification of the /ram
            drive.  The identification is the lower nybble of the device
            number.  The standard identification is 15.
