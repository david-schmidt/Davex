pg -- display plain text or AWP file a page (screen) at a timesyntax:  pg <pathname> [-h] [-f] [-u] [-l] [-t tab_string]ex:      pg this         pg ?:txt -h         como newfile;pg oldfile -l         pg that -t"    "Types contents of a file (any type, not just TXT).  Wildcards are allowed.  -h generates a header giving the date/time the file was last modified.  -f disables filtering of control characters; normally they are filtered out.-u and -l force all alphabetic characters to display in uppercase or lowercase, respectively.-p begins a new page after the file is printed.-t lets you specify a string to be printed in place of each TABcharacter (Ctrl-I).  You may want to make an alias for 'pg' witha tab string.At the bottom of each screen, you are prompted   --- xx% --- more? (Y/N)where xx is the percent of the file (calculated by counting characters, not lines) you have read so far.When output is redirected to a file or to the printer, no prompting takes place.Note:  many file types do not contain plain text.  This command          knows how to interpret AWP files, but simply displays all other         files byte-for-byte.  If you type a SYS file, for example, you         will get a lot of garbage and (probably) a few readable        messages.(see also:  type, como, strings, alias)
