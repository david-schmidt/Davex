expand -- Expand tabs (EXTERNAL) [v1.1]
          Written by Jeff Ding

syntax:  expand <pathname> [-c<ascii number>] [-t<number>]
                [-s"<tabstop 1,tabstop 2,tabstop 3,....,tabstop 16>"] 

ex:      expand file.w.tabs
         expand merlin.s -c160 -s"14,20,35"
         > file.no.tabs ; expand file

'Expand' expands up to 16 definable tab stops per line in the given
pathname.  Line lengths of up to 255 characters are supported.  Longer
lines are split into multiple lines.  Use output redirection on the
command line to save output in a file (last example).  The second
example works great for viewing Merlin source files.

Options are as follows: 

    -c: character for tab.  Enter the ascii value of the character
        to use for the tab expansion.  The default character is value 9
        for ctrl-I.  The tab character is hi-bit sensitive.

    -t: tab spaces.  This is the number of spaces between two consecutive
        tab stops, normally 8.  Can be any number from 1 to 255.

    -s: tab stops.  Up to 16 tab stops can be defined manually.  Each stop
        must be greater than the previous with no value exceeding 255.
        If less than 16 stops are defined, the remaining stops are
        constructed from the defined tab spaces.
