It is especiallyuseful if you have a lot of subdirectories, since it will lookinside any subdirectories it finds.The various options can be combined in a large number of useful ways;no attempt is made here to illustrate all the possible combinations.pathname: Tells 'ffind' where to look.  If you leave this out, it      looks on all the ProDOS volumes in your system.  Wildcards are      not currently allowed.  -n: Specifies a string which must be contained in a filename      before 'ffind' will print it.  Example:  ffind -n copy      finds all files having "copy" somewhere in their names.  -e: Forces -n to find only exact matches (not files whose names      merely *contain* the specified string).  [This option is      meaningful only if you use -n.]  -f: Tells 'ffind' what filetype to look for.  Example:      ffind -fawp  finds AppleWorks Word Processor files.   -x: Tells 'ffind' what auxiliary type to look for.  Example:      ffind -fbin -x$800  finds binary files that load at $800.  -b: Tells 'ffind' to look for files that have their "need      backup" flag set (-by) or clear (-bn).  (The backup bit is      displayed in 'cat' listings and by the 'info' command; it      gets set whenever a file is changed, and you can clear it      with the -b option of the 'copy', 'update', or 'touch'      commands.)  -d: 'ffind' normally prints detailed information on each      match found, like this:         filetype  auxtype last-modified-date pathname      The -d option tells 'ffind' NOT to print this detailed      information about each file.  (Note that earlier versions      of 'ffind' defaulted to no detailed information, and the -d      option forced its inclusion.)  -q: Stands for "query"--forces 'ffind' to stop after every      match and ask "Continue search? (y/n)"  -p: Sets your prefix to the directory containing the last      match found.  -o: The string following "-o" will be printed for each pathname      found, but the pathname found will be printed in place of any      "=" characters in the string.  [This is useful for generating      script files to be 'exec'ed later.  See 'help =' for more      discussion, since the '=' command has a similar feature.]  -i: Tells 'ffind' to look for files that have their "invisible"      flag set (-iy) or clear (-in).  (The invisible flag is      displayed in 'cat' listings (use -i to see invisible files)      and by the 'info' command.  You can set or clear it with the      -i option of the 'touch' command.)  -s: Tells 'ffind' what storage type to look for.  Example:      ffind -s5  finds all GS/OS "extended" files.  This might      come in handy when copying lots of files, since Davex (and      ProDOS 8) can't work with extended files.
