copy -- copy files or directories

syntax:  copy <pathname1> <pathname2> [-f] [-d] [-b]

ex:      copy thing /otherdisk/blah
         copy this /backup
         copy %= /backup/= -fb
         copy /system.disk/system /ram5/system

Copies files from first path to second path.  Unless -f
(force) is given, ask for permission to replace the old
copy.  If the old file is LOCKED (access is not "rwnd"),
copy asks for permission even if you use -f.

-d deletes the original after a successful copy.  -b clears
the backup bit of the original after a successful copy.

If the first pathname refers to a file and the second
pathname refers to a directory, 'copy' puts the file INTO
the directory.  (It does not replace the directory with the
file.)

If you omit the second pathname completely, 'copy' behaves
as though you supplied the current prefix.  Result:  "copy
pathname" copies a file into the current directory, using
the original file's filename.

If the first pathname refers to a DIRECTORY, the directory
and everything in it (files and/or directories) is copied to
the second pathname.  The second pathname must not refer to
an existing directory ("ProDOS error: duplicate file" results).

'copy' will copy sparse files, but the new files will no
longer be sparse.

'copy' can't copy extended files (storage type 5).  You get
a "bad storage type" error for trying.  (Extended files have
two forks and are created under GS/OS.)
