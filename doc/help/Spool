spool -- spool files for later printing

syntax:  spool [<pathname>] [-z] [-x <int1>]

ex:      spool ?:txt
         spool
         spool -z
         spool -x3

Queues files for background printing.  Wildcards are allowed.  You 
must remain in Davex until the printing completes, and you may not 
redirect output to the printer (see 'como'), since that would make a 
mess.

Use the 'config' command to set the slot 'spool' will print to.

'spool -z' Zaps the spool queue (cancels printing of all spooled 
           files) and formfeeds the printer.

'spool' shows a numbered list of files waiting to print.

'spool -x' cancels one file in the queue by number.


NOTE:  The text of spooled files is sent directly to the printer.  
       This is fine for TXT files (and SRC files, and possibly some 
       other filetypes).  It is NOT fine for AWP files (try it if you 
       want...it's sort of entertaining).

       A future Davex version will probably support spooling AWP 
       files.  For now, create a temporary file, 'pg' the AWP file 
       into it, and spool the temporary file.  Example:

          como temp;pg my.awp.file
          spool temp

Spool does not work well with speech synthesizers; Davex does not have 
control while the system is waiting for keyboard input.  Speech 
synthesizer users can use the 'wait' command to let spooled files 
print.

(SPOOL stands for Simultaneous Peripheral Operation On-Line.)
