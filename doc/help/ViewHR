viewhr -- view a hi-res picture (EXTERNAL) [v1.1]  Written by Jeff Ding

syntax:  viewhr <pathname>

ex:      viewhr /picture.disk/pic.1
         viewhr /picture.disk/pic=

'viewhr' displays a hi-res picture on the screen without leaving
the Davex command shell.  Wildcards are accepted in the pathname.
Once the picture is displayed, any key will exit.  Ctrl-C will
abort wildcard expansions.

'viewhr' makes sure the filetype is BIN or FOT and the auxtype is set
to $2000 or $4000.  It then loads $2000 bytes of the file and displays
it on the screen.  It is possible to view double-hires pictures but
you will only see half of the picture.
