delete -- destroy files or directoriessyntax:  delete <pathname> [-u]ex:      delete this         delete =.0 -u         delete ?:dirPermanently destroys the specified file or directory.  Wildcardsare allowed.Before destroying a directory, the 'size' command is automaticallyused to compute the total size of the directory and everything in it, and you are given a chance NOT to destroy the directory.-u unlocks a file before trying to destroy it.  When deleting adirectory, -u unlocks each file before it is destroyed; otherwiseany locked file in a directory will cause delete to stop with onlysome of the files deleted.
