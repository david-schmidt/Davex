err -- print ProDOS error messagesyntax:  err <integer>ex:      err 70         err $46Prints the ProDOS error message corresponding to the given error code.  'err 0' prints a list of all the errors in thetable.Davex never prints an error number if a message is available instead.  This command is useful if you get an error code from a program that doesn't have a table of ProDOS error messages built in.  (Applications created by 'sysalias' willprint two-digit error codes if something goes wrong; use"err $xx" to see what they mean.)
