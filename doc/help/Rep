rep -- repeat:  execute a command several times

syntax:  rep <integer>

ex:      rep 10;echo "Ten!"
         como &;rep 5;type handout= -p

Executes the next command the specified number of times.
'rep 0' has no effect, and the largest number 'rep' accepts
is 65535.  'rep' will not repeat another 'rep' command.

The second example prints 5 copies of all files beginning in
"handout" to the printer.  All repetitions are executed for
each file matching the wildcard before Davex looks for
another wildcard match.
