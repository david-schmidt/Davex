alias -- display or modify command aliases

syntax:   alias [-s] [-l] [-r] <alias-name> <expansion>

ex:       alias
          alias foo "cat -am"
          alias -r foo
          alias -s
          alias -l

With no parameters, displays a list of all current aliases.
These are stored in the file %aliases (which you can edit
with a text editor if you want).

Given two strings, 'alias' creates a new alias so that the
first string, when used as a command, expands into the second
string.  If there are blanks in the second string, you need
to put quotation marks around it.  If the named alias already
exists, 'alias' asks for permission to replace it.

Given -r and a single string, 'alias' removes an existing
alias.

Creating or removing an alias does not automatically save it to
disk.  To save your aliases to %aliases, use 'alias -s'.  (Note
that if you create or remove an alias and use -s in the same
command, the saving happens -after- any changes to your aliases.)

To re-load your aliases from %aliases, use 'alias -l'.  Davex
automatically loads aliases from there, so this is not normally
needed.

See Davex.Doc for an explanation of aliases and a description
of the pre-made aliases provided.
