modchk -- compare modification dates on pairs of files (EXTERNAL)

syntax:  modchk <pathname1> <pathname2> [-q] [-o] [-n] [-s]

ex:      modchk thisfile thatfile
         modchk /disk/= /backup/= -o -n
         modchk =.s = -n

Checks the last-modification dates on a pair of files.  Wildcards 
are allowed.  If none of -o (older), -n (newer), or -s (same) is 
given, a message of the form

     <pathname1> <relation> <pathname2>

is displayed.  Relation is "<" (older), "=" (same), or ">" 
(newer).  If one or more of -o, -n, or -s appears, pathname1 is 
displayed only if the files satisfy one of the specified 
conditions.

The second example above displays the names of files on /disk 
which are older OR newer than the files with the same names on 
/backup.  The third example above displays the names of ".s" 
files that have been modified since their corresponding files 
without the ".s" suffix.  This is useful for insuring that you 
have not changed an assembly language source file without 
recompiling it.

If -q (quiet) is given, no complaint is displayed if the second 
file doesn't exist.
