ptype -- display a Pascal Text file ($03) (EXTERNAL)

syntax:  ptype <pathname>

ex:      ptype foo.bar
         ptype .61=:$03

'ptype' displays the contents of a Pascal Text file (filetype
$03).  The first 1024 bytes are ignored; the rest of the file
is plain text except that Ctrl-P ($10) means the next byte
represents a number of blanks.
