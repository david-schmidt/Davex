blist -- list a BAS file in ASCII (EXTERNAL) [v1.2]syntax:  blist <pathname> [-w <integer>]ex:      blist this         como &;blist ?:bas -w70         como edit.this;blist myprogList a BAS file in readable form.  Wildcards are allowed.  Intended for redirecting to a TXT file to allow editing with a word processor.  The edited file can then be EXECed in BASIC.SYSTEM, turning it back into an Applesoft program which can be SAVEd and RUN.The -w option specifies the wrap margin.  'blist' will starta new line and indent 6 spaces when this margin is hit, orwhen a blank is printed within 10 columns of the margin.If you are using 'blist' to send a listing to your printer,you may need to use -w to prevent long lines from overprintingthemselves.Version 1.2 fixes a spacing bug in REM and DATA statements thatdidn't begin with a blank.
