ftype -- display or update your filetype name table

syntax:  ftype [-r<ftype>] [-a<string> -v<ftype>] [-z]

ex:      ftype
         ftype -rbas
         ftype -r1
         ftype -aLNK -v$F8
         ftype -z

Davex has two lists of filetype names:  one is in your %config
file (maximum of 63 entries), and the other one is built into
Davex.  Entries in your table can override built-in entries.

'ftype' with no options displays all filetypes in your %config
file, followed by all the filetypes in the internal list.

-r removes the given filetype from your list.

-a and -v are used together to add one filetype to your list.  
Case is unimportant when looking for a filetype in the table,
BUT the types are displayed with the case you use in the -a
option.

'ftype -z' (zap) wipes out any extra filetypes you have
added (with ftype -a) to your %config file, leaving only
the built-in table.
