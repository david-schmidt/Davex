size -- show size of file or directory

syntax:  size <pathname>

ex:      size this
         size =:sys
         size .61=:dir

For a non-directory file, prints file size in blocks and in 
bytes.  For a directory, compute and print the sum of the 
sizes of all the files and directories within the directory.  
Wildcards are allowed.

The total size in BYTES of a directory is often MUCH smaller 
than 512 times its size in BLOCKS, even though all blocks 
are 512 bytes long.  This is because not all the bytes of a 
file's last block are used.  As an extreme example, a 
directory containing 12 files of one byte each would have a 
size of 13 blocks (1 for the directory and 1 each for the 
files), but only 524 bytes (512 for the directory block and 
1 each for the files).

(Note that the size reported for a volume directory includes 
actual directory blocks but omits the 2 boot blocks and the 
bitmap block(s).  There is one bitmap block for every 4096 
blocks on the volume.)
