wc -- character/word/line count program (EXTERNAL) [v2.0]
      Written by Jeff Ding

syntax:  wc <pathname1..5> [-c] [-w] [-l] [-t] [-d<number>] [-e<number>]
            [-m<number>]

ex:      wc text.file1 text.file2 text.file3
         wc apple.txt -lw -m60
         wc read.me -d138

'Wc' with no options prints the number of characters, words, and lines in
the given file.  The file type is not checked so any file of any type can
be given on the command line.  Up to five file names can be given on the
command line at any one time.  AppleWorks word processor files are
supported.  The standard delimiter between two words is a space.  The
standard end of line delimiter is a carriage return.   

If more than one file is given on the command line, 'wc' version 2.0 will
print the grand total of characters, words, and lines.  If wildcards are
used, the grand total will be printed after every file matching the
wildcard starting with the second file.  Printing of the grand total is
also subject to the -c,-w, and -l options.

Options are as follows: 

    -c: print character count.
    -w: print word count.
    -l: print line count.

    -t: print grand totals only.

    -d: delimiter for end of line.  Enter the ascii value of the character
        after the -d.

    -e: delimiter between words.  Enter the ascii value of the character
        after the -e.

    -m: wrap margin.  Use this option to force the number of lines to  
        increment at either a specific margin or a space within 9 characters
        of the margin.  This option is good for files that use a carriage  
        return to specify paragraphs instead of lines.  Allowed values are
        0 through 255.  A 0 value has the same effect as not using the
        option.
     
Note:   You can mix the -c, -w, -l options in different combinations.
        The hi-bit of each character in the file is ignored.
