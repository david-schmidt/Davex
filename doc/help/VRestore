vrestore -- restore a ProDOS volume from a file (EXTERNAL) [v1.1]syntax:  vrestore <pathname> <device number> [-f]ex:      vrestore /my.disk/image.of.ram .32         vrestore .61/ram5.image .52 -f'vrestore' reconstructs a ProDOS volume from a file.  The filemust have been created earlier with 'vstore'.  The reconstructedvolume completely replaces any information on the destinationdevice.The -f option forces 'vrestore' to destroy any existing data onthe destination disk without asking.  If you don't use -f, itasks for permission first.'vstore' and 'vrestore' are especially useful with RAM disksthat have no battery backup.  If the stored image was too bigto fit on one disk, 'vrestore' will prompt you to insert thenext disk in the same drive as the first one.'vrestore' v1.1 assumes that the destination device has thesame number of blocks as the original volume (the one the imagewas created from).  [A future version of 'vrestore' may allowthe destination device to be larger, provided the number ofbitmap blocks is the same.  One bitmap block is needed forevery 4096 blocks.]   Note: v1.1 actually doesn't even check thenumber of blocks on the destination device.  You can restoreto a bigger device if you want to, but the extra blocks will notbe available for file storage.(see also: vstore)
