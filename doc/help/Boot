boot -- boot the systemsyntax:  boot [-s<slotnum>] [-i]ex:      boot         boot -s6Boots the system.  If -s is given, boots from the specified slot, which should contain a disk controller.  Otherwise the system scans for a startup device the same way it does at power-up.The -i option is meaningful only on a IIgs.  If present, an ICE COLD reboot is done, erasing everything in RAM (including /RAM5).-s is ignored when -i is used.  [NOTE--'boot -i' takes advantageof an undocumented aspect of the keyboard microcontroller and isNOT guarranteed to work in the future.  Test it with any hardwareor system software upgrades before trusting it.]
