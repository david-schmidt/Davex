brun -- run a BIN file

syntax:  brun pathname

ex:      brun myprogram

'brun' is a SYS file that accepts a parameter (in its startup buffer).
The pathname must specify a BIN file.  'brun' will load and execute the
BIN file at its auxiliary type address.  Many BIN files are intended
to be executed in a certain environment, such as BASIC.SYSTEM.  'brun'
is useful only for BIN files that do NOT expect an environment to be
set up for them.  Kyan Pascal programs, for example, can be run with
'brun'.

Be careful!  Not all BIN files are suitable for running with 'brun'.
If you're not sure if a particular BIN file will run OK or not,
write-protect your disks (turn off a hard drive, save RAM disks to
real disks, etc) before trying to run it.

If a ProDOS error occurs while 'brun' is loading the BIN file, a
two-digit error code is displayed, and you will be returned to
Davex (if you ran 'brun' from there) when you hit a key.  To find
out what the error was, you can type "err $xx" from Davex.

If the specified file is not a BIN file, error $FF is reported.

Note:  'brun' with a last-modified date of 12-Dec-87 or later
supports BIN files that RTS or JMP to $3D0, $3D3, or $BE00 rather
than doing a ProDOS QUIT.  Previous versions worked only with
BIN files that did a QUIT.

Also, 'brun' stores a BRK instruction at $BE03 and $BE70.  If you
get dropped into the monitor at $BE03 or $BE70, the BIN file you
were trying to run probably requires BASIC.SYSTEM.
