touch -- touch a file's last-mod date, backup bit, invisible bit, or
         disable bit

syntax:  touch <pathname> [-b y|n] [-d y|n] [-i y|n]

ex:      touch myfile
         touch =:bin -iy
         touch ?:cda -dn
         touch ? -bn

'touch' with no options sets a file's modification date/time to the
current date and time without actually modifying the file's contents.
Wildcards are allowed.

This is intended for use with recently-created files that, for some
reason, are not properly date- and time-stamped.  (Some DOS 3.3-to-
ProDOS conversion programs, for example, stamp files with an invalid
date and time.)

The -b option lets you set or clear the "needs backup" bit on a
file.  Use -by to set the bit or -bn to clear it.  See also 'copy',
'update', 'cat', and 'ffind'.

The -i option lets you set or clear a file's "invisible" bit.
Invisible files don't show up in Davex catalog listings unless the
catalog command's -i option is used.  The "invisible" bit has been
recently defined by Apple, and other programs may or may not pay
attention to the invisibility of a file.

The -d option lets you ENABLE or DISABLE certain types of Apple IIgs
files.  A disabled file is not loaded automatically at boot time.
The filetypes that can be disabled are $B6 (permanent init file), $B7
(temporary init file), $B8 (new desk accessory), $B9 (classic desk
accessory), $BB (driver), $BC (generic load file), and $BD (GS/OS file
system translator).  [Bit 15 of the auxiliary type for these filetypes
is the disable bit.]
