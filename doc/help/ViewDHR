viewdhr -- view a double hi-res picture (EXTERNAL) [v1.1]  Written by Jeff Ding

syntax:  viewdhr <pathname> [-f] [-r]

ex:      viewdhr /picture.disk/pic.1
         viewdhr /picture.disk/pic.1 -f
         viewdhr /picture.disk/pic=

'viewdhr' displays a double hi-res picture on the screen without leaving
the Davex command shell.  Wildcards are accepted in the pathname.Once the
picture is displayed, any key will exit.  Ctrl-C will abort wildcard
expansions.  'viewdhr' will not work on a II+ or 64k //e because they do
not have the auxiliary memory needed to display double hi-res pictures.
This  program will work on a //c, //e compatible with an extended 80 column
card, and the //gs.

In order for 'viewdhr' to work you have to uninstall the ram driver in
slot 3 drive 2.  To do that you have to use the 'ram3' external command.
The following options are available:

     -f: force load -- This option will force the program to load the
         picture regardless of the status of the ram drive.  Use this
         option with caution as it will destroy any files that might
         be stored in that memory

     -r: reverse pages -- This option will load the picture in reversed
         format.  Normally the first half of the file is loaded into the
         auxiliary memory and the second half into the main memory.  Using
         this option will switch the main and auxiliary pages in memory.

'viewdhr' makes sure the filetype is BIN or FOT and the auxtype is set
to $2000.  It then loads the file and displays it on the screen.  It
will not load the picture if the length is less than $2001 bytes.
