rename -- change name of file, directory, or volume

syntax:  rename <pathname> <pathname>

ex:      rename this that
         rename /blank /mydisk
         rename letter= ltr.=

Changes the name of a file, directory, or volume.  Wildcards 
are allowed, as in the third example.  A wildcard in the 
second pathname expands to the same text the wildcard in the 
first pathname is matching.  The third example changes the 
names of files beginning with "letter" to begin with "ltr." 
instead.

If you change the name of an AppleWorks file (filetypes AWP, 
ADB, and ASP) from Davex, you may find the capitalization to 
be strange.  This is because AppleWorks stores the 
capitalization information in the file's Auxiliary type, 
which is not affected by this command.  Use Apple-N while 
editing the file in Appleworks to fix the capitalization.
