tail -- Display end of file (EXTERNAL) [v1.0]
        Written by Jeff Ding

syntax:  tail <pathname> [-l<number>] [-w<number>] [-d<ascii number>]

ex:      tail long.file
         tail read.me -l10
         > & ; tail wide.file -w132

'Tail' displays the ending of a file without having to wait for the
beginning part to scroll by on the screen.  This command is useful for
quickly displaying the ending of any file that is very long.  Wildcards
are supported.

Options are as follows:

    -l: number of lines to print.  This defaults to 5 lines.  You can
        specify 'tail' to print any number of lines from 1 to 255 off
        the end of a file.  A 0 value has the same effect as not using
        the option.

    -w: wrap margin.  Use this option to force the number of lines to
        increment at either a specific margin or a space within 9 characters
        of the margin.  This option is good for files that use a carriage
        return to specify paragraphs instead of lines.  Allowed values are
        0 through 255.  A 0 value has the same effect as not using the
        option.  The default wrap margin is set to 79.

    -d: delimiter for end of line.  Enter the ascii value of the character
        after the -d.
