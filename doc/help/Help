help | ? -- display command information

syntax:  help [string]

ex:      help
         ?
         help topics
         ?cat

'help' or '?' alone prints a list of built-in commands.

'help' or '?' followed by a command name or topic prints information
on that command or topic.  Type "help topics" for a list of available
help topics.

It is not necessary to put a blank after the '?' command.

Note about ALIASES:  'help' doesn't currently understand aliases.
To get help on a "command" like "dir" (really an alias for 'cat')
you have to type "help cat" (or "?cat"), not "help dir".  ['Help'
may be more intelligent about aliases in a future version of Davex;
for now, you'll have to type "alias" to see what the real name for
your command is.]

To save disk space, most of the help files have been compressed and
included in the file "indexed.help" in the help directory.  The
help directory is normally %help, but the 'config' command can be
used to put the help somewhere else.  When you ask for help on a
given topic, 'help' always looks for a file with the same name in
the help directory before consulting the indexed help file.
