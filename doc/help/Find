find -- search a file for lines containing a string (EXTERNAL) [v1.1]

syntax:  find <pathname> [<string>] [-L<integer>] [-w<integer>]
              [-c] [-n]

ex:      find phones frank
         find .61= -n
         find /info/addresses "John S" -L5

'find' searches files for lines containing a specified string.
Each matching line (each one containing the string) is displayed
(non-printable characters appear as periods).

pathname: Specifies what file to search.  Wildcards are allowed.
      Note:  'find' is appropriate for searching (AppleWorks Word
      Processor (AWP) files as well as "plain text" files (TXT and
      SRC, for example).

string: Specifies what to search for.  If this string contains
      blanks or begins with a "-", you must put quotation marks
      around it (use either ["] or [']).  (If you omit the
      string, all lines in the file will be counted as matches.)
      Uppercase and lowercase letters are considered the same.

  -c: Count the number of matching lines instead of displaying
      them.  (Use -L1 to display matches *and* the count.)

  -L: Specifies the number of consecutive lines to display starting
      with each matching line.  If you do not give this option, only
      the matching lines are displayed.  (If -c is given, no lines 
      are displayed unless you also use -L.)

      [An additional line printed after a match may itself be a
      matching line.  In cases like this, 'find' continues printing
      lines until the requested number of lines have been printed
      after the last match.]

  -n: Causes line numbers to appear before every line displayed.
      The line numbers may not correspond exactly to the line
      numbers you see in AppleWorks, since 'find' ignores lines
      containing formatting commands.

  -w: Sets the wrap margin for breaking a file into lines.  You will
      probably have no need for this option unless the files you are
      searching use carriage-return to mark *paragraphs* rather than
      lines (for example, most AppleWriter files).

      The wrap margin defaults to 70.  You can specify your own margin
      with the -w option (your margin must be in the range 11 to 254).

      A line ends when (1) it hits the wrap margin, (2) at a carriage
      return, or (3) at a blank within 9 characters of the wrap margin
      (whichever comes first).

[Note--find v1.0 failed to find strings at the beginning of a line.]
