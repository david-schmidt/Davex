vstore -- store a ProDOS volume into a file (EXTERNAL) [v1.1]syntax:  vstore <volume name> <pathname>ex:      vstore /ram /my.disk/image.of.ram         vstore /ram5 .61/ram5.image'vstore' stores an image of a ProDOS volume into a file (orseveral files on different disks).  'vrestore' is used torestore the volume from the stored image.  'vstore' and'vrestore' are especially useful with RAM disks that don'thave a battery backup.'vstore' will prompt you to insert another disk wheneverone is full.  This means you can store a large RAM disk(or even a hard disk) on a number of smaller disks.'vstore' and 'vrestore' are not intended to replace yournormal backup procedures.  You should still keep normalcopies of your files somewhere, in case the large deviceyou are storing becomes unavailable.  For example, a storedimage of your 1024K RAM disk will not be useful if you haveto send in your RAM board for repair--but normal copies ofthe files would be useful.Note that a file created by 'vstore' is normally "sparse,"so that its physical length is less than its logical length.(This is because 'vstore' leaves gaps in the file correspondingto unused blocks on the volume being stored.)  However, manyfile-copy commands (including Davex's copy command at present)don't preserve the sparseness when you copy a file.  Theresulting files may be much larger than the originals, so youwill probably not want to copy files created by 'vstore'.(Copying *disks* containing sparse files is no problem, though.)The 'what' command recognizes files created by 'vstore' anddisplays some useful information about them.  The files arenow stored with filetype $E0 and auxiliary type $8004.(see also: vrestore, what)
