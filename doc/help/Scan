scan -- examine or change the scan listsyntax:  scan [-r<string>] [-a<string>] [-z]ex:      scan         scan -z         scan -a /ram         scan -a *         scan -a .61         scan -a .62utils         scan -r /hard2/sys/With no options, prints the list of directories Davex scans when you type something that isn't an internal command.Use the -a and -r options to add or remove a paths from the list.The special path '*' in the scan list tells Davex to scan thedirectory your prefix is set to.Use 'scan -z' to reset the scan list to the default (the defaultis "%" followed by "*").Note:  If '%' and '.##' shorthand forms are used in the scanlist, they are expanded during scanning, not when they are enteredinto the list.  This lets you specify that Davex should scancertain _drives_ (or directories on whatever volumes are found inthem) rather than certain volumes.
