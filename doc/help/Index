index -- create, add to, and view sections of indexed files
         [EXTERNAL] (v1.0)

syntax:  index <pathname> [-s <index-size>] [-a <filename>]
                          [-e <string>] [-v <string>]

ex:      index %help/indexed.help -s1200
         index %help/indexed.help -aprefix -ecd
         index %help/indexed.help -vprefix

'index' is used to build the %indexed.help file containing most of the
help files for Davex.  Use the -s (size) option to create a new file,
reserving the specified number of bytes for the index.  Use the -a option
with a filename to append the contents of a file to an existing indexed
file.  The -e option is used if you want to add an alternative key to
the index for a file--the second example above adds the contents of a
file called "prefix" to an index file, and the text can later be accessed
with a key of either "prefix" or "cd", since "cd" appears after the -e
(extra key) option.

The -v option lets you look up things in an indexed file; it's equivalent
to what the 'help' command does with %help/indexed.help if it doesn't
find a particular file first.
