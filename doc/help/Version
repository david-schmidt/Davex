version -- print Davex version information

syntax:  version

ex:      version

The 'version' command reprints the header you normally see
when you enter Davex.  (Depending on the 'config -q' setting,
you may not see the header when you enter.)

The version number and serial number on your copy of Davex
are displayed.  This header also appears when you press
Ctrl-RESET (*not* Apple-Ctrl-RESET).
