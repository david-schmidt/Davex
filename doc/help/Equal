= -- print a complete pathname or a string built from a templatesyntax:  = <pathname> [<template>]ex:      = %         = xyz         como my.list;= =:bas         = .61prodosPrints a complete pathname.  Wildcards are allowed.  The first example prints the pathname of the Davex directory.  The second builds a complete pathname by appending the given partial path to the current prefix.  The third prints, into a file called "my.list", complete pathnames for all BAS files in the current directory.  The fourth prints the pathname of a file PRODOS in slot 6, drive 1.When '=' is used without wildcards, as in the fourth example, files with the printed pathnames do not necessarily exist.The Power of TemplatesWhen the second parameter is given, wildcard expansion still takesplace on the first parameter, but the _second_ parameter is printed,once all wildcard characters have been replaced.Suppose you want to use the "blist" external command to list a groupof BAS files into TXT files with corresponding names in anotherdirectory.         como cmd.file;= ?:bas "como /disk/listings/=;blist ="If this looks complicated, don't worry--it is.  First, ">" is used toredirect output to the file "cmd.file"--we are building a list ofcommands to be executed with "exec cmd.file" later.  The rest of the lineis a single use of the "=" command.  The first parameter is "?:bas"--soyou are prompted yes or no for each bas file.  For the ones you respondYes to, a string is printed to cmd.file.  The string is bulit from thethird parameter to "=", which is "como /disk/listings/=;blist =".Suppose you responded Yes to three files:  grapes, apples, and banjos.Then cmd.file would contain the following:  como /disk/listings/grapes;blist grapes  como /disk/listings/apples;blist apples  como /disk/listings/banjos;blist banjos
