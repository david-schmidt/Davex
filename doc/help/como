como -- redirect command output to file or printer

syntax:  como <pathname>

ex:      como listing;type =:txt -h
         como &;cat -t
         como 2;type davex.doc

For commands on the same line only, redirects output that would
normally appear on the screen.  If the specified file exists,
output will be appended to it.  If it does not exist, it will be
created as a TXT file.

Output can be redirected to a device by slot number, as in the
third example.

'&' (or '0') represents the printer slot set by 'config'.

Even while spooled files are printing, you can redirect output
to a slot.  (Not to the SAME slot 'spool' is printing to.)

Note:  If no pathname is specified, output redirection is
cancelled; output returns to the screen.  (The same thing happens
automatically after the whole command line is processed, so this
feature is rarely needed.)

A standard alias "print" is provided; it stands for "como &;", so
you can do things like

  print help    (same as "como &;help")

  print;pg foo  (same as "como &;;pg foo"
                 [extra ";" doesn't matter])

(see also:  exec, config)
