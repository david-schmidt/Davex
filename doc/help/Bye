bye -- quit Davex

syntax:  bye

ex:      bye

Quits Davex.  (Does a ProDOS QUIT to whatever Quit code was
in place when you entered Davex.)  If you have different
copies of Davex in different directories, you can run one
copy from another one, and Quit will return you to the one
you were in previously.

(The old quit code is stored in %config when you enter
Davex.  When you quit, it loads the old quit code from
%config, so you need to have your Davex disk online.)
