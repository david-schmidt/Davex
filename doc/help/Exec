exec -- get keyboard input from a file

syntax:  exec <pathname>

ex:      exec foo.bar

Makes keyboard input come from the specified file until an 
error occurs or until end of file is reached.  Wildcards are 
allowed.  The file must be of type TXT ($04), SRC ($B0),
or $C6/$8001 (Davex 8 Script).

If %autoexec exists, Davex automatically execs it on entry.
(If another pathname is passed to Davex in its startup buffer,
Davex attempts to exec the specified file instead of %autoexec.)

Command prompts and commands will not appear on the screen
while the file is being exec'ed (but the commands DO get
stored in the History buffer, so you can use the up arrow to
see what commands were executed; this is useful if an error
occurs during the exec).
