split -- split off sections of files (EXTERNAL) [v1.1]
         Written by Jeff Ding

syntax:  split <input pathname> [<output pathname>] [-s<number>]
               [-e<number>|-l<number>] [-b y|n] [-f] [-d<number>]
               [-w<margin>]

ex:      split infile outfile -s0 -e1023
         split infile -s50 -e100 -bn
         split file1 -s50 -l100 -bn -m60
 
'Split' splits off a section of the input file into the output file.
If the output file is not specified, output goes to the screen.  The
input file is never modified.  Wildcards are supported.

'Split' works with any file type, but the input file is always treated
as a raw collection of bytes.  This means, for example, that you can
split off a piece of an AWP file, but the resulting smaller file will
not be a valid AWP file.  However, you can always use 'combine' to put
a big file back together from pieces created with 'split'.

The starting position is determined by the number after -s. The ending
position is determined by either -e (end) or -l (length).  Note that
length = end - start + 1.

The starting/ending/length parameters are measured in either bytes or
lines.  Use the -b (count by bytes) parameter with a yes/no value to
choose:  -by to count by bytes; -bn to count by lines.  If you don't
use the -b option, 'split' counts by bytes.

Options are as follows:

    output pathname: split section is saved to this file.  If not
                     specified, output goes to the screen.  The output
                     file type will always be the same as the input
                     file type.

    -s: starting offset position.  The first byte in a file has an
        offset of 0.  The first line in a file has an offset of 1.
        If not specified, the start position is set to the beginning
        of the file.

    -e: ending offset position.  Maximum offset is 16777214.  If not
        specified, the ending position is set to the end of the file.

    -l: length of section.  Maximum length is 16777214.  Use either
        -e OR -l.  If -e is given, -l is ignored.

    -b y|n: measurement in bytes (yes) or lines (no).  Bytes is the
        default.

    -f: force overwrite.  Skips the "Okay to overwrite" question if
        the output file already exists.

    -d <ascii number>: this determines what character is used for the line
                       delimiter.  Use the ascii value for the character.

    -w <margin>: wrap margin.  Affects output to the screen only.  This
                 will force a carriage return when either the margin or
                 a space within 9 characters of the margin is reached.
                 Allowed values are 0 through 255.  A 0 value has the same
                 effect as not using the option.


Version 1.1 fixes a bug when specifying an output file and not using
the -e option.
