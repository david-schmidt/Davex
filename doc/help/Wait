wait -- wait for spooled files to finish printing

syntax:  wait

ex:      wait;ej;park

'wait' simply sits there and does nothing until files 
spooled with the 'spool' command are done printing.  Press 
any key to abort the wait and return to the command prompt.

(The example assumes that 'park' is available as a SYS or 
S16 file or external Davex command; it would presumably park 
the heads on your hard drive.)
