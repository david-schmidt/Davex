conp -- display or change IIgs Control Panel information (EXTERNAL)

syntax:  conp [-k pathname] [-l pathname]
              [-a audio] [-s slots] [-1 port1]
              [-2 port2] [-r RAMdisk] [-o options]
              [-d display] [-f fast] [-c clock]

ex:      conp             -- display all settings
         conp -a -r       -- display audio and RAMdisk settings
         conp -ap13v>2    -- set pitch to 13, increase volume by 2
         conp -k my.bram  -- keep all settings in a file
         conp -l %?.bram  -- load all settings from a file
         conp -rs8        -- set RAMdisk size to 8 chunks of 32K=256K
         [more examples below]

'conp' can display and set all the options the IIgs's control panel
desk accessory can.  ('conp' is especially useful to voice synthesizer
users.  Other users will find the -k and -l options handy, and may
want to include other 'conp' commands in exec files (see "exec").)

Options set with 'conp' are stored in the IIgs's 256 bytes of battery
RAM, in exactly the same format the Control Panel stores them.  Note
that RAMdisk and Slots settings do not take effect until the next
power-up or "boot -i".

'conp' has 11 parameters.  All of them are optional.  If no parameters
are given, all settings are displayed.  -k requires the name of a file
(which will be created if it doesn't exist); it saves all the battery
RAM settings into the file.  -l also requires the name of a file; it
restores all battery RAM settings from the file.  (If the file
contains invalid information, battery RAM will revert to defaults.)

The remaining options are categories of options.  The categories are:
audio, RAMdisk, options, display, clock, fast, slots, port 1, and port
2.

For any category that is given, settings may or may not appear after
it.  If no settings are found after a category, the current settings
for that category are displayed.  The settings allowed in each
category are listed below.

Note on numeric values:  in almost all cases, you can put a "<" or ">"
before a number.  This decreases or increases the existing value for
a setting, instead of specifying the new value from scratch.  For
example,

   conp -av>1

bumps the Volume up one notch.

-----
Category:  audio (-a)
Settings:  v  volume    value: 0 to 14
           p  pitch     value: 0 to 14

Sets the system volume and the pitch of the standard bell tone.
Note:  If no value appears after v or p, the volume or pitch can
be set interactively.  Use the left and right arrows to adjust the
volume, and press RETURN to finish.

Examples:  conp -avp      --sets volume and then pitch, interactively
           conp -ap>2v<1  --bump pitch up 2 notches, volume down 1

-----
Category:  slots (-s)
Settings:  i  internal  (followed by slot numbers)
           x  external  (followed by slot numbers)
           b  boot      0 to 9 (0=scan, 8=RAMdisk, 9=ROMdisk)

Examples:  conp -sb5x1i52  -- set boot to slot 5, slot 1 external ("your
                              card"), and slots 5 and 2 internal

           conp -sb0       -- scan (boot from highest bootable device)

-----
Category:  port 1 (-1)  (normally printer port)

Settings:                      (value)

  dv  device connected         m or p (modem/printer)
  l   line length              u=unlimited, 40, 72, 80, 132
  dl  delete 1st LF after CR   y/n
  al  add LF after CR          y/n
  e   echo                     y/n
  bf  buffer                   y/n
  br  baud rate                0 to 14 (%%% fix this)
  ds  data/stop bits           5/1, 5/2 to 8/1, 8/2
  p   parity                   e (even), o (odd), n (none)
  ch  Carrier handshake (DCD)  y/n
  dh  DSR/DTR handshake        y/n
  xh  X-on/X-off handshake     y/n

Examples:  conp -1bfyds8/1pn  -- buffering on, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit,
                                 no parity

-----
Category:  port 2 (-2)  (normally modem port)
Settings:  same as for printer port

Examples:  conp -2luxhn   -- line length unlimited, X-off handshake off

-----
Category:  fast (-f)

Well, this isn't really a category.  A simple "y" or "n" is expected.
"Y" sets fast mode (2.8 MHz); "N" sets slow mode (1.0 MHz).

Examples:  conp -fn    -- slow
           conp -fy    -- fast

-----
Category:  RAMdisk (r)
Settings:  s  size      -- sets minimum and maximum size
           a  minimum   -- sets minimum size
           b  maximum   -- sets maximum size

All values refer to a number of 32K chunks.

Examples:  conp -rs0       -- set RAMdisk size to 0
           conp -rs4       -- set RAMdisk size to 128K (=4x32K)
           conp -ra10b20   -- set minimum size to 320K, max to 640K

(Note that the new size does not take effect until a power-up or a
"boot -i".)
-----
Category:  clock (c)
Settings:  NONE YET (NOT DONE)

-----
Category:  display (d)
Settings:  tx  text color              0 to 15
           bk  text background color   0 to 15
           bd  border color            0 to 15
           80  80 columns on RESET and power-up?  y/n
           m   monochrome monitor?     y/n

Examples:  conp -dtx15    -- show white text
           conp -dbd0     -- black border
           conp -d80ymn   -- 80 columns on RESET, color monitor

Note:  the "m" option has no effect on the display of an RGB monitor.
Some programs do not work properly when the "80" option is on.

-----
Category:  options (-o)

Settings:

  tl text language             0 to 31 (MOST VALUES ILLEGAL? %%%)
  kl  keyboard language        0 to 31 (MOST VALUES ILLEGAL? %%%)
  kb  keyboard buffering       y/n
  rs  repeat speed             0 to 7
  rd  repeat delay             0 to 4 (4=no repeat)
  dc  double click time        0 to 4
  fr  flash rate               0 to 4
  cs  caps+shift = lower case  y/n
  fs  fast space/delete        y/n
  ds  dual-speed keys          y/n
  hm  high-speed mouse         y/n

Notes:  The keyboard buffering is 16 characters within the IIgs (provided
by the Keyboard Microcontroller), plus an additional 3 characters within
the keyboard itself, if you have the external Apple Desktop Bus keyboard.
Some programs don't work properly with keyboard buffering turned on. When
keyboard buffering is on, Ctrl-Apple-DELETE empties the buffer.
