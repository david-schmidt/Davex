eject -- eject a volume or all volumes from SmartPort

syntax:  eject [pathname]

ex:      eject
         eject /mydisk
         eject .52

Ejects the specified 3.5" volume from a UniDisk 3.5 or Apple
3.5 drive.  If no volume name is given, all 3.5" disks are
ejected.

Note that the parameter is a PATHNAME, so a command like
"eject .52" makes Davex try to find the name of the volume in
slot 5, drive 2 before searching all drives to find that volume.
So 'eject' will not help you eject individual non-ProDOS disks
or individual plastic shipping disks.
