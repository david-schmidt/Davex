# Davex

Davex is a command-line shell for the Apple II family of computers, written by Dave Lyons starting in 1988.  It offers a rich set of built-in as well as external commands, and you can also [write your own](https://github.com/david-schmidt/Davex/wiki/Writing-external-commands) commands.  Davex runs on ProDOS 8, and a subset of functionality is ported to SOS.
